<div>
                     user="usernmae",       # username
                     <div>
                     passwd="password",     # password
                     <div>
                     db="database")   # name of the database

<div>
print("<a href='home path'>Home</a>")
<div>
print("</th><th></th><th>")
<div>
print("<a href='selfcompare path'>GENE 48th selfcompare</a>")

<div>
Do the same in home.py, lines 187-189
